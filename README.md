# CSES Solutions

My solutions to [CSES problems](https://cses.fi/problemset/), organized by category.

The `better` directory contains optimized or more elegant solutions for some problems.
I wrote them after consulting other people's answers and resources.

Solutions I felt were particularly clunky (though passed the time and memory limits)
are marked with a "BRUH MOMENT" comment and further explanation. They often have a
`better` counterpart.
